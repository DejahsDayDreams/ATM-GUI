# ATM-GUI
Using Java AWT,I have create a new ATM GUI that will meet the following specifications: 
• User must login 
• User must be able to draw or deposit money 
• User must be able to see total amount in their account 
• The GUI must be new, moderate and easy to use 
• Use correct color schemes that are friendly and not distracting

I wanted to experiment with JForms but still keep with the specification of using AWT.
